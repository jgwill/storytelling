## Package Overview
> A Python package (aliases: `willwrite`, `specforge`) that empowers users to manifest complete, coherent narratives from a single prompt. Uses LangGraph state machines, multi-provider LLM support, RAG knowledge integration, session persistence, and Indigenous ceremonial frameworks.
- **Repository**: [storytelling/](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling)
- **Specifications**: [rispecs/](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/tree/main/rispecs)
- **Related**: Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, IAIP, COAIA

## Core Modules

### CLI & Entry Points
> Three CLI aliases (`storytelling`, `willwrite`, `specforge`) for generating stories, managing sessions, and configuring generation parameters.
- **Source**: [storytelling/cli.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/cli.py)

### Story Generation Graph
> LangGraph state machine orchestrating the multi-stage pipeline: prompt analysis → story elements → outline → chapters (4 scenes each) → revision → final assembly.
- **Source**: [storytelling/graph.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/graph.py)

### Session Management (PHOENIX_WEAVE)
> Persistent creative workspaces with checkpoint/resume across interruptions. Auto-saves at natural story progression boundaries.
- **Source**: [storytelling/session_manager.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/session_manager.py)

### LLM Provider Abstraction
> URI-based multi-provider system supporting Google (Gemini), Ollama, OpenRouter, and custom endpoints. Each generation stage can use a different model.
- **Source**: [storytelling/llm_providers.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/llm_providers.py)

### RAG Integration (Enhanced Multi-Source)
> Knowledge-aware generation from local markdown files, web content, and CoAiAPy datasets. FAISS vector store with configurable embedding providers.
- **Source**: [storytelling/rag.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/rag.py)

### Narrative Intelligence
> Character arc tracking, emotional beat enrichment, and thematic continuity analysis across generated narratives.
- **Source**: [storytelling/narrative_intelligence_integration.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/narrative_intelligence_integration.py)

### IAIP Bridge (Indigenous-AI Integration)
> Five-phase ceremonial methodology mapping story generation to Indigenous protocols: sacred space → two-eyed research → knowledge integration → creative expression → ceremonial closing.
- **Source**: [storytelling/iaip_bridge.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/iaip_bridge.py)

### MCP Server
> Model Context Protocol server enabling LLM agents (Claude, Gemini) to orchestrate story generation, session management, and model validation.
- **Source**: [storytelling_mcp/](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/tree/main/storytelling_mcp)

## Configuration
> 40+ parameters controlling models, RAG, quality, workflow stages, translation, and debug modes. URI-based model selection per generation stage.
- **Source**: [storytelling/config.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/config.py)
- **Spec**: [rispecs/Configuration.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/Configuration.md)

## Data Schemas
> Pydantic models for story state, chapters, scenes, session checkpoints, and narrative intelligence structures.
- **Source**: [storytelling/data_models.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/data_models.py)
- **Spec**: [rispecs/DataSchemas.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/DataSchemas.md)

## Tiered Package Architecture
> Core (~50MB) → +RAG (3-5GB) → +Specialized. Users install only what they need; graceful degradation when optional dependencies are absent.
- **Spec**: [rispecs/Tiered_Package_Architecture.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/Tiered_Package_Architecture.md)

## Specifications (rispecs/)
> Complete RISE-framework specifications describing the application as implementation-agnostic blueprints focused on creative advancement.
- **Index**: [rispecs/](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/tree/main/rispecs)
- **Governing**: [Creative_Orientation_Operating_Guide.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/Creative_Orientation_Operating_Guide.md), [Terms_of_Agreement.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/Terms_of_Agreement.md)
