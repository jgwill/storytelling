# Traditional Technologies and Innovation

## Indigenous Computing Concepts

Many Indigenous cultures developed sophisticated information processing systems through beadwork, quipus, songlines, and other traditional technologies that encoded complex data and computational processes.

## Sustainable Design Principles

Traditional Indigenous building and design practices often incorporate principles of sustainability, biomimicry, and harmony with natural systems that are increasingly relevant to contemporary innovation.

## Algorithmic Thinking

Traditional practices like basket weaving, beadwork patterns, and textile creation often employ algorithmic thinking and recursive patterns that parallel modern computational concepts.
