# Indigenous Knowledge Systems

## Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk)

Two-Eyed Seeing is a guiding principle developed by Mi'kmaq educators that encourages learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledge and ways of knowing, and to use both eyes together for the benefit of all.

## Recursive Methodologies

Indigenous research often employs recursive methodologies where knowledge is built through iterative cycles of observation, reflection, and ceremonial integration. This differs from linear research models by embracing spiraling patterns of understanding.

## Land-Based Knowledge

Traditional knowledge is intimately connected to specific places and landscapes. This knowledge is not abstract but embodied, relational, and tied to the health and wellbeing of particular ecosystems and communities.
