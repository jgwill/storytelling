# Ceremonial Research Practices

## Research as Ceremony

Shawn Wilson's concept that "research is ceremony" emphasizes that research should be conducted with the same respect, intentionality, and relational accountability as traditional ceremonies.

## Relational Accountability

Research must consider relationships - to community, to land, to ancestors, and to future generations. Knowledge creation is not extractive but reciprocal and responsible.

## Sacred Knowledge Protocols

Some knowledge is sacred and restricted, requiring specific protocols, permissions, and ceremonial contexts. Researchers must understand and respect these boundaries.
