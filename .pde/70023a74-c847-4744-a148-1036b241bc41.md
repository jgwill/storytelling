# Prompt Decomposition

## Directions

## Original Prompt

> KINSHIP Hub Establishment & NARINTEL Documentation Transformation (Issues #21, #22, #23, PR #20)

## Primary Intent

**Action:** establish
**Target:** KINSHIP.md as the relational hub charter for the storytelling package
**Urgency:** immediate
**Confidence:** 95%

## Secondary Intents

1. **transform** — MISSION_251231.md into KINSHIP.md via git mv _(explicit)_
2. **rewrite** — KINSHIP.md content to follow Kinship Hub schema (Identity/Purpose, Lineage/Relations, Accountabilities, Responsibilities/Boundaries, Change Log) _(explicit)_
   - depends on: transform MISSION_251231.md into KINSHIP.md
3. **upgrade** — NARINTEL_README.md with quality content reflecting kinship vision and Indigenous epistemological grounding _(explicit)_
   - depends on: establish KINSHIP.md
4. **upgrade** — NARINTEL_USER_SCENARIOS.md with deeper ceremonial-technology alignment _(explicit)_
   - depends on: establish KINSHIP.md
5. **consolidate** — NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt content into NARINTEL_README.md, then remove the .txt _(explicit)_
   - depends on: upgrade NARINTEL_README.md
6. **map** — rispecs/COORDINATION_FROM_* files into KINSHIP.md lineage/relations section _(explicit)_
   - depends on: rewrite KINSHIP.md content
7. **reference** — /a/src/IAIP/rispecs as sibling kinship hub in KINSHIP.md _(explicit)_
   - depends on: rewrite KINSHIP.md content
8. **map** — ava-lang* ecosystem (Python and TypeScript packages) as descendants/siblings in KINSHIP.md _(implicit)_
   - depends on: rewrite KINSHIP.md content
9. **consolidate** — NARINTEL_QUICK_START.md — either merge into README or keep as lightweight entry point _(implicit)_
   - depends on: upgrade NARINTEL_README.md
10. **clean** — NARINTEL_FILES_SUMMARY.txt — redundant with improved README _(implicit)_
   - depends on: consolidate NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt

## Context Requirements

### Files Needed
- MISSION_251231.md
- NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt
- NARINTEL_README.md
- NARINTEL_USER_SCENARIOS.md
- NARINTEL_QUICK_START.md
- NARINTEL_FILES_SUMMARY.txt
- llms/llms-kinship-hub-system.md
- llms/docs/kinship-hub.md
- llms/llms-rise-framework.txt
- llms/llms-stc-state-machine.md
- rispecs/COORDINATION_FROM_STORYTELLING_INSTANCE.md
- rispecs/COORDINATION_FROM_IAIP_Inquiry__RCH_Indigenist_9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645.md
- rispecs/COORDINATION_FROM_NARINTEL_INSTANCE.md
- rispecs/Creative_Orientation_Operating_Guide.md
- rispecs/Terms_of_Agreement.md

### Tools Required
- git mv
- git add
- git commit
- file editor

### Assumptions
- MISSION_251231.md content is the seed material for KINSHIP.md — not a direct copy but a transformation
- The NARINTEL_* files were generated by a less capable model and need substantive quality improvement
- The Kinship Hub protocol in llms/llms-kinship-hub-system.md is the authoritative schema
- NARINTEL codename refers to decolonized narrative intelligence — Indigenous E/O/M/A compatible
- The user wants fewer but higher-quality documentation files
- Coordination files in rispecs/ are inter-agent communication artifacts, not specifications

## Four Directions Analysis

### 🌅 EAST — VISION

- Envision KINSHIP.md as the living charter that maps storytelling's identity, lineage, accountabilities, and relational web within the ceremonial-technology ecosystem [95%]
- Understand NARINTEL as structural reorientation toward Indigenous E/O/M/A — not decorative language [93%]

### 🔥 SOUTH — ANALYSIS

- Analyze MISSION_251231.md to extract content that maps to Kinship Hub schema sections [92%]
- Analyze COORDINATION_FROM_* files to extract lineage and relational data [88%]
- Study llms/docs submodule to understand the portfolio of guidances and where storytelling sits [85%] _(implicit)_

### 🌊 WEST — VALIDATION

- Validate KINSHIP.md against llms-kinship-hub-system.md schema — all required sections present [95%]
- Validate NARINTEL_README.md captures consolidated overview without losing essential content [88%]
- Ensure no working files are lost — commit before delete [90%] _(implicit)_

### ❄️ NORTH — ACTION

- Execute git mv MISSION_251231.md KINSHIP.md [98%]
- Rewrite KINSHIP.md to Kinship Hub schema [95%]
- Upgrade NARINTEL_README.md with quality content [90%]
- Upgrade NARINTEL_USER_SCENARIOS.md [90%]
- Consolidate NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt into README then remove [92%]
- Commit each logical step [95%]

## Action Stack

- [ ] git mv MISSION_251231.md KINSHIP.md to preserve git history
- [ ] Analyze MISSION_251231.md content for Kinship Hub schema mapping
- [ ] Analyze COORDINATION_FROM_* and ecosystem paths for lineage/relations data
- [ ] Rewrite KINSHIP.md following Kinship Hub minimal schema with ecosystem relations (depends on: git mv MISSION_251231.md KINSHIP.md)
- [ ] Commit KINSHIP.md transformation (depends on: Rewrite KINSHIP.md)
- [ ] Consolidate NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt valuable content into NARINTEL_README.md (depends on: Commit KINSHIP.md)
- [ ] Upgrade NARINTEL_README.md with quality content and kinship-aligned framing (depends on: Consolidate NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt)
- [ ] Upgrade NARINTEL_USER_SCENARIOS.md with ceremonial-technology alignment (depends on: Upgrade NARINTEL_README.md)
- [ ] Remove NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt and NARINTEL_FILES_SUMMARY.txt (depends on: Consolidate NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt)
- [ ] Commit NARINTEL documentation upgrades (depends on: Remove NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt)
- [ ] Validate KINSHIP.md against schema and ecosystem coverage (depends on: Commit KINSHIP.md)

## Ambiguity Flags

- **"Should NARINTEL_QUICK_START.md be kept as a separate file or merged into README?"**
  - Suggestion: Keep it if it serves a distinct lightweight entry-point purpose; merge if it's redundant with the upgraded README
- **"Exact scope of 'quality upgrade' for NARINTEL files — rewrite completely or improve incrementally?"**
  - Suggestion: Substantive rewrite with kinship-aligned framing while preserving valuable domain content
- **"Should KINSHIP.md preserve any of the original MISSION_251231.md code examples?"**
  - Suggestion: Transform code examples into specification references; KINSHIP.md should be a relational charter, not an implementation plan

## Expected Outputs

### Artifacts
- KINSHIP.md

### Updates
- NARINTEL_README.md
- NARINTEL_USER_SCENARIOS.md

### Communications
- Git commits with meaningful messages for each logical step
