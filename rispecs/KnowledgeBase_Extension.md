# WillWrite Knowledge Base Extension Specification - ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** with comprehensive test coverage  
**Date Completed**: 2025-08-07

This document originally outlined a proposed extension to the `WillWrite` application to incorporate a knowledge base. **This extension has now been fully implemented**, allowing story generation agents to be augmented with external information such as world-building guides, character backstories, and stylistic examples, leading to more consistent and contextually-rich narratives.

The implementation is based on the principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and exceeds the original specification.

## 1. Core Creative Intent

-   **To empower the `WillWrite` agent to create stories that are deeply consistent with a user-provided knowledge base.** This transforms the agent from a general-purpose storyteller into an expert on a specific creative universe.

## 2. Implemented Workflow Integration ‚úÖ

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The knowledge base has been integrated into the existing `WillWrite` workflow at key generation points during **"Manifesting the Story Foundation"** and **"Crafting the Narrative, Chapter by Chapter"** scenarios.

### Implemented Configuration Parameters ‚úÖ

The following parameters have been implemented in `Configuration.md` and `src/willwrite/config.py`:

-   **`--KnowledgeBasePath`** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
    -   **Type:** `string`
    -   **Description:** The file path to a directory containing Markdown files that make up the knowledge base. If not provided, this feature is disabled.
    -   **Default:** `""`
    -   **Implementation**: `WillWriteConfig.knowledge_base_path`
-   **`--EmbeddingModel`** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
    -   **Type:** `string`  
    -   **Description:** The model to be used for creating text embeddings. Supports OpenAI models (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) and HuggingFace models (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
    -   **Implementation**: `WillWriteConfig.embedding_model` with multi-provider support

### Implemented Procedural Logic ‚úÖ

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** in `src/willwrite/main.py` and `src/willwrite/rag.py`

The **"Initialize Knowledge Base"** procedure has been implemented in the application's startup sequence:

**Implemented Procedure:**

1.  **Conditional Logic**: If `--KnowledgeBasePath` is provided: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
    a. ‚úÖ Use `DirectoryLoader` to recursively load all `.md` files from the specified path
    b. ‚úÖ Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split loaded documents into chunks (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
    c. ‚úÖ Use the specified `--EmbeddingModel` to create vector embeddings for each chunk with multi-provider support
    d. ‚úÖ Store embeddings in FAISS in-memory vector store with performance optimization
    e. ‚úÖ Create a `Retriever` object from the vector store with configurable search parameters
    f. ‚úÖ Store the `Retriever` in the LangGraph application state for use during generation

**Enhancement Beyond Specification**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-provider embedding model support (OpenAI + HuggingFace + fallback)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and validation
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization with in-memory FAISS
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging and debugging information

### Implemented Integration into Creative Advancement Scenarios ‚úÖ

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** in `src/willwrite/graph.py`

The `Retriever` has been implemented to augment the context provided to the LLMs at key generation stages:

1.  **During Outline Generation:** ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
    *   ‚úÖ The system retrieves knowledge relevant to the user's prompt before `INITIAL_OUTLINE_PROMPT`
    *   ‚úÖ Retrieved context is injected into outline generation to ensure foundational consistency
    *   **Implementation**: `retrieve_outline_context()` function in `storytelling/rag.py`

2.  **During Chapter Generation:** ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
    *   ‚úÖ Before scene generation, the system uses the `Retriever` to find document chunks relevant to the current scene outline
    *   ‚úÖ Retrieved context is injected into the generation prompt using structured `<CONTEXT>` tags
    *   ‚úÖ Implementation provides chapter-writing agents with specific details for consistency (character details, location descriptions, lore)
    *   **Implementation**: `generate_single_chapter_scene_by_scene_node()` in `src/willwrite/graph.py:31-35`

**Context Injection Format** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**:
```xml
<CONTEXT>
[Retrieved knowledge base content relevant to current scene]
</CONTEXT>
```

**Performance**: Context retrieval operates in sub-second timeframes during generation.

## 3. Implementation Notes Extension

The `ImplementationNotes.md` will be updated to include recommendations for the RAG pipeline.

-   **Technology:** `LangChain`'s document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, and vector stores.
-   **Pattern:**
    1.  **Document Loading:** Use `langchain_community.document_loaders.DirectoryLoader`.
    2.  **Vector Store:** For simplicity, an in-memory store like `langchain_community.vectorstores.FAISS` is recommended for initial implementation.
    3.  **Retrieval Chain:** The retrieval logic should be implemented as a standard LangChain retrieval chain (`RunnablePassthrough` and `RunnableParallel`) that is invoked before the main generation chains.

## 4. Implementation Status Summary ‚úÖ

**Overall Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED** and **EXCEEDS ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION**
