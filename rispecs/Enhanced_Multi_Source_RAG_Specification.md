# Enhanced Multi-Source RAG Specification
**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Framework**: RISE (Reverse-engineer → Intent-extract → Specify → Export)  
**Status**: Production-Ready Implementation

## Executive Summary

The Enhanced Multi-Source RAG system transforms story generation from reactive content creation to **creative archaeology** - where writers excavate insights from diverse knowledge sources to manifest rich, contextually-grounded narratives. This specification defines a system that enables writers to naturally progress from scattered inspiration to unified creative output through **advancing patterns** rather than oscillating content generation loops.

## RISE Framework Application

### Phase 1: Reverse-Engineering (Creative Archaeology)
**Current Reality**: Writers struggle with disconnected information sources - web research, curated datasets, local knowledge bases exist in silos, requiring manual context switching and losing creative flow.

**Beloved Qualities Discovered**:
- **Serendipitous Discovery**: Web URLs reveal unexpected narrative connections
- **Curated Wisdom**: Langfuse datasets contain refined creative insights  
- **Personal Knowledge**: Local files hold writer's accumulated creative foundation
- **Contextual Coherence**: RAG retrieval creates natural story progressions
- **Cost-Effective Generation**: Gemini 2.5 Flash maintains quality while enabling extensive experimentation

### Phase 2: Intent-Extraction (Structural Tension Dynamics)
**Desired Outcome**: Writers create rich, contextually-enhanced narratives by naturally integrating multiple knowledge sources without losing creative momentum.

**Structural Tension Components**:
- **Current Reality**: Fragmented knowledge sources requiring manual integration
- **Desired Outcome**: Unified, contextually-aware story generation
- **Natural Resolution**: Automated multi-source knowledge unification with intelligent retrieval

**Advancing Patterns Identified**:
1. **Progressive Knowledge Building**: Each source type enhances rather than replaces others
2. **Contextual Amplification**: Retrieved knowledge enhances rather than constrains creativity
3. **Session Continuity**: Tracing and observations create learning across sessions
4. **Source Transparency**: Writers understand knowledge origins and can refine sources

#### Advancing Pattern Implementations

##### 1. Progressive Knowledge Accumulation
**Specification**: Each knowledge source enhances others through semantic cross-referencing rather than creating information silos.

**Implementation**:
- **Web Content**: Fetched URLs tagged with retrieval metadata and cached for reuse
- **CoAiAPy Integration**: Datasets and prompts processed with source attribution
- **Local Files**: Existing knowledge bases preserved with version tracking
- **Unified Indexing**: All sources embedded in single FAISS vectorstore with source differentiation

**Structural Dynamics**: Knowledge sources create natural progression where each addition amplifies existing creative foundation.

##### 2. Session-Based Learning & Traceability
**Specification**: Each story generation session creates observational data that advances future creative work.

**Implementation**:
- **Langfuse Tracing**: Complete session tracking with observations for each processing step
- **Local Trace Files**: JSON exports for session analytics and retrospection
- **Observation Categorization**: Events, spans, and generations tracked with detailed metadata
- **Performance Metrics**: Generation time, token usage, and quality metrics preserved

**Structural Dynamics**: Sessions build cumulative creative intelligence rather than starting from scratch each time.

##### 3. Contextual Enhancement Patterns
**Specification**: Retrieved knowledge enhances rather than constrains creative expression through context-aware integration.

**Implementation**:
- **Outline-Level RAG**: Knowledge retrieval during initial story structuring
- **Scene-Level RAG**: Context injection during detailed narrative generation
- **Multi-Query Retrieval**: Diverse query construction from story elements
- **Context Categorization**: Retrieved content organized by relevance and source type

**Structural Dynamics**: Knowledge retrieval creates expanding creative possibilities rather than limiting constraints.
