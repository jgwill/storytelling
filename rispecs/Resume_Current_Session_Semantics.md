# Resume Current Session — Semantics & Flow ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Structural Tension
- **Desired Outcome**: Predictable, seamless resume behavior that continues creation from natural story progression boundaries, enabling narrative forking and iterative creative exploration
- **Current Reality**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Comprehensive SessionManager with automatic checkpoint preservation and intelligent resume entry point determination
- **Natural Progression**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** - Complete session management architecture with standardized checkpoint format and robust state reconstruction

## Implementation Status: ✅ PHOENIX_WEAVE COMPLETE

### Operational Session Management Architecture
- **SessionManager Class**: Complete session lifecycle management
- **Automatic Checkpointing**: Every workflow node preserves creative state
- **Intelligent Resume**: Dynamic entry point determination and graph reconstruction  
- **CLI Integration**: Full command interface for session management
- **Migration Support**: Convert existing sessions to new persistent format

### Advancing Moves ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Natural Boundary Model**: Resume at story elements, outline, chapter generation, and completion boundaries
- **Rich Checkpoint Data**: Complete SessionCheckpoint dataclass with state, metadata, and timestamps
- **Commands**: `--resume <session_id>`, `--list-sessions`, `--session-info <id>`, `--migrate-session <id>`
- **Perfect Idempotence**: Resume continues from optimal next step, never duplicates work
- **Acceptance Criteria ACHIEVED**:
  - ✅ Resume continues at next natural workflow step without text duplication
  - ✅ Completed boundaries advance automatically to next creative phase  
  - ✅ All resume actions logged with boundary context
  - ✅ Checkpoints are completely self-contained for full state reconstruction

## Standardized Checkpoint Format ✅ IMPLEMENTED

A standardized JSON checkpoint file is generated at each workflow boundary. This file encapsulates the complete state required to re-hydrate the application. Implementation is in `storytelling/session_manager.py`.

**Schema:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "timestamp": "string",
  "current_state": {
    "current_chapter_index": "integer",
    "last_completed_stage": "string",
    "config": { /* Full WillWriteConfig object */ },
    "initial_prompt": "string",
    "outline": "string",
    "story_elements": { /* StoryElements object */ },
    "chapters_completed": [ /* List of completed chapter texts */ ],
    "rag_system_state": { /* State of the RAG system, e.g., vector store path, embedding model */ }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "generation_time_so_far": "float",
    "total_words_generated": "integer",
    "llm_calls_count": "integer"
  }
}
```
**Key Considerations:**
- **Self-Contained**: The checkpoint must contain all necessary data (config, prompts, generated content, RAG state references) to restart the generation without external dependencies (other than the knowledge base files themselves).
- **Version Compatibility**: Future-proofing for schema evolution will be considered (e.g., versioning the checkpoint format).
- **Security**: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys) will not be stored directly in the checkpoint; they will be loaded from environment variables or secure configuration.

## Re-hydration for Narrative Forking

**Infrastructure**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**User-Facing Commands**: ⏳ PLANNED

The standardized checkpoint format enables powerful narrative forking capabilities through the implemented infrastructure:

1.  **Load Checkpoint** ✅: The `SessionManager.load_session_state()` can restore `StoryState` from any checkpoint
2.  **Modify State** (Infrastructure Ready): State can be programmatically modified after loading
3.  **Continue Generation** ✅: The `create_resume_graph()` function enables continuation from any checkpoint
4.  **Iterative Exploration** (Planned): User-facing commands for checkpoint-based forking and state modification are under development

**Current Capabilities**: The infrastructure fully supports narrative forking through the session management system. Direct CLI commands for forking workflows are planned for future releases.

This mechanism transforms the session system from a mere record-keeper into a dynamic foundation for creative exploration and iterative storytelling.
