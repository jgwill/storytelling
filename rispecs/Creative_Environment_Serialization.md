# Creative Environment Serialization Specification

**Status**: ⏳ PLANNED (Specification Complete, Implementation Phases Pending)

## Structural Tension
- **Desired Outcome**: Perfect creative consciousness fidelity across session resume boundaries, enabling users to continue stories with identical narrative voice, tone, and creative environment regardless of interruption timing
- **Current Reality**: SessionManager preserves story content and basic state excellently, but enhanced environment state (config fingerprints, RAG state preservation, model context) is planned for future implementation
- **Natural Progression**: Evolve SessionCheckpoint architecture to capture and restore complete creative environment state, eliminating potential oscillation in narrative continuity

## Creative Intent Discovery

### What This Enables Users to Create
Based on the agent analysis from REPORT.250831.gemini.md, this specification addresses **Loom's Narrative Drift Concern**:

> "If a user resumes a session with a different configuration, the 'creative environment' is not identical. This can lead to a slight drift in tone or style, a minor break in the 'emotional architecture.'"

**Users will create**:
1. **Bit-Perfect Creative Continuity**: Stories that resume with identical creative consciousness regardless of system changes
2. **Temporal Creative Consistency**: Long-term story projects that maintain consistent voice across weeks or months
3. **Environment-Aware Resume**: Intelligent warnings when creative environment has changed
4. **Creative State Forensics**: Ability to understand and recreate exact conditions that produced specific narrative qualities

### Advancing Pattern Architecture

#### Phase 1: Enhanced SessionCheckpoint Structure
**Current Implementation**:
```python
@dataclass
class SessionCheckpoint:
    checkpoint_id: str
    node_name: str
    timestamp: str
    state: Dict[str, Any]        # Story content state
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]     # Basic context
```

**Enhanced Structure**:
```python
@dataclass
class SessionCheckpoint:
    checkpoint_id: str
    node_name: str
    timestamp: str
    state: Dict[str, Any]        # Story content state
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]     # Basic context
    
    # NEW: Creative Environment Preservation
    creative_environment: CreativeEnvironmentState
```

#### Phase 2: CreativeEnvironmentState Dataclass
```python
@dataclass
class CreativeEnvironmentState:
    """Preserve complete creative environment for perfect resume fidelity"""
    
    # Configuration Fingerprint
    config_snapshot: Dict[str, Any]    # Complete config state at checkpoint
    config_hash: str                   # Verification hash
    
    # RAG System State
    retriever_state: Optional[RAGState] = None
    knowledge_base_fingerprint: Optional[str] = None
    embedding_model_state: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Model Context Preservation  
    model_configurations: Dict[str, ModelState]
    active_model_contexts: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    
    # Creative Session Context
    creative_momentum_indicators: Dict[str, Any]
    narrative_style_fingerprint: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Environment Validation
    environment_signature: str         # Complete environment hash
    resume_compatibility_level: str    # "perfect", "high", "medium", "warning"

@dataclass
class RAGState:
    """Preserve RAG system state for identical knowledge retrieval"""
    vector_store_state: Optional[str]
    knowledge_base_path: str
    embedding_model: str
    last_retrieval_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    retrieval_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]

@dataclass  
class ModelState:
    """Preserve model configuration and context for identical generation"""
    model_uri: str
    model_parameters: Dict[str, Any]
    provider_state: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    last_generation_context: Optional[str]
```

#### Phase 3: Creative Environment Capture
**Integration with existing SessionManager**:

```python
def save_checkpoint(self, session_id: str, node_name: str, state: Dict[str, Any], metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> None:
    """Enhanced checkpoint saving with creative environment preservation"""
    
    # Existing checkpoint creation
    checkpoint = SessionCheckpoint(...)
    
    # NEW: Capture creative environment
    creative_environment = self._capture_creative_environment(state)
    checkpoint.creative_environment = creative_environment
    
    # Save enhanced checkpoint
    self._save_checkpoint_with_environment(checkpoint)

def _capture_creative_environment(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> CreativeEnvironmentState:
    """Preserve complete creative environment state"""
    config = state.get('config')
    retriever = state.get('retriever')
    
    # Configuration snapshot
    config_snapshot = config.model_dump() if config else {}
    config_hash = self._generate_config_hash(config_snapshot)
    
    # RAG state preservation
    rag_state = None
    if retriever:
        rag_state = RAGState(
            vector_store_state=self._capture_vector_store_state(retriever),
            knowledge_base_path=getattr(retriever, 'knowledge_base_path', ''),
            embedding_model=getattr(retriever, 'embedding_model', ''),
            last_retrieval_context=getattr(retriever, '_last_context', None)
        )
    
    # Model state capture
    model_configurations = self._capture_model_states(config)
    
    # Environment signature for validation
    environment_signature = self._generate_environment_signature(
        config_snapshot, rag_state, model_configurations
    )
    
    return CreativeEnvironmentState(
        config_snapshot=config_snapshot,
        config_hash=config_hash,
        retriever_state=rag_state,
        model_configurations=model_configurations,
        environment_signature=environment_signature,
        resume_compatibility_level="perfect"
    )
```

#### Phase 4: Environment-Aware Resume
**Enhanced state reconstruction with environment validation**:

```python
def load_state_from_session(self, session_id: str, config, logger, retriever=None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Enhanced session loading with creative environment validation"""
    
    # Load checkpoint with environment
    checkpoint = self._load_checkpoint_with_environment(session_id)
    creative_env = checkpoint.creative_environment
    
    # Validate current environment vs. saved environment
    compatibility = self._assess_environment_compatibility(creative_env, config, retriever)
    
    if compatibility.level == "warning":
        logger.warning(f"Creative environment has changed: {compatibility.differences}")
        logger.info("Story may experience subtle narrative drift")
        
    elif compatibility.level == "perfect":
        logger.info("Creative environment perfectly preserved")
    
    # Optionally reconstruct original environment
    if self.restore_original_environment:
        config, retriever = self._restore_creative_environment(creative_env)
        logger.info("Original creative environment restored")
    
    # Standard state reconstruction with environment context
    resume_state = {
        "config": config,
        "logger": logger,
        "retriever": retriever,
        **checkpoint.state,
        
        # NEW: Environment awareness
        "creative_environment": creative_env,
        "environment_compatibility": compatibility
    }
    
    return resume_state

@dataclass
class EnvironmentCompatibility:
    level: str  # "perfect", "high", "medium", "warning"
    differences: List[str]
    recommendations: List[str]
```

## Integration with Agent Architecture

### Relationship to Planned Agent System
The agents directory reveals a comprehensive terminal-based agent system design. Creative Environment Serialization enhances this architecture:

#### Agent-Session Integration
**From agents/README.md analysis**:
- **Continue Chapter Command**: Enhanced with perfect environment restoration
- **RAG Agent Integration**: State preservation enables consistent knowledge context
- **Quality Control Loop**: Environment consistency ensures critique/revision fidelity

#### Enhanced Agent Commands
```bash
# Environment-aware resume with validation
/continue-chapter --session <id> --validate-environment

# Resume with environment compatibility report
/continue-chapter --session <id> --show-compatibility

# Force original environment reconstruction  
/continue-chapter --session <id> --restore-environment
```

### Terminal Agent Benefits
**From AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md integration**:
1. **Granular Control**: Agents can query and modify creative environment state
2. **Consistency Validation**: Critic agents can detect environment-based drift
3. **Intelligent Resume**: Vision agents can assess environment compatibility
4. **Cost Optimization**: Avoid regeneration by preserving expensive model contexts

## Implementation Phases
