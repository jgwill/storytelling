Here is my outline for this chapter:
<CHAPTER_OUTLINE>
{ThisChapterOutline}
</CHAPTER_OUTLINE>

{FormattedLastChapterSummary}

As you write your work, please use the following suggestions to help you write chapter {_ChapterNum} (make sure you only write this one):
    - Pacing: 
    - Are you skipping days at a time? Summarizing events? Don't do that, add scenes to detail them.
    - Is the story rushing over certain plot points and excessively focusing on others?
    - Flow: Does each chapter flow into the next? Does the plot make logical sense to the reader? Does it have a specific narrative structure at play? Is the narrative structure consistent throughout the story?
    - Genre: What is the genre? What language is appropriate for that genre? Do the scenes support the genre?

{Feedback}

{ThisChapterOutline}
</CHAPTER_OUTLINE>

{FormattedLastChapterSummary}

And here is what I have for the current chapter's plot:

</CHAPTER_PLOT>

As a reminder to keep the following criteria in mind as you expand upon the above work:
    - Characters: Who are the characters in this chapter? What do they mean to each other? What is the situation between them? Is it a conflict? Is there tension? Is there a reason that the characters have been brought together?
    - Development: What are the goals of each character, and do they meet those goals? Do the characters change and exhibit growth? Do the goals of each character change over the story?
    - Details: How are things described? Is it repetitive? Is the word choice appropriate for the scene? Are we describing things too much or too little?

Don't answer these questions directly, instead make your writing implicitly answer them. (Show, don't tell)

Make sure that your chapter flows into the next and from the previous (if applicable).

     - Pacing: 
       - Are you skipping days at a time? Summarizing events? Don't do that, add scenes to detail them.
       - Is the story rushing over certain plot points and excessively focusing on others?
