## Package Overview

Storytelling (aliases: `willwrite`, `specforge`) empowers users to manifest complete, coherent narratives from a single creative prompt. The system orchestrates a multi-stage generation pipeline — from prompt analysis through story elements, outlines, chapter-by-chapter scene generation, revision passes, and final assembly — producing publication-ready stories with full session persistence.

What distinguishes this package from other generation tools is its orientation: it is built on **Creative Orientation** (Robert Fritz's structural dynamics), not problem-solving. The language, architecture, and specifications all embody generative creation — advancing toward desired outcomes rather than eliminating deficiencies. It also integrates **Indigenous ceremonial frameworks** (IAIP) as a first-class concern, treating story generation as a relational and ceremonial practice.

The package is part of a larger ecosystem documented in the [LLMS-txt Portfolio](https://llms.jgwill.com), which bridges Indigenous epistemologies, AI systems design, and narrative storytelling.

## Story Generation Pipeline

The core pipeline is implemented as a LangGraph state machine with checkpoints at each stage, enabling full resume capability:

### Four Creative Advancement Scenarios

**Scenario 1 — Manifesting the Story Foundation:**
1. **Prompt Analysis** — Extract meta-instructions (chapter count, tone, constraints) from user prompt
2. **Story Element Generation** — Manifest characters, plot, theme, conflict, setting, symbolism via LLM
3. **Initial Outline Creation** — Generate chapter-by-chapter structure with arc progression
4. **Outline Refinement** — Critic → feedback → revision loop for structural integrity

**Scenario 2 — Crafting the Narrative, Chapter by Chapter:**
1. **Establish Chapter Context** — Determine total chapter count, generate scene-by-scene outlines
2. **Staged Content Generation** (4 layers per chapter):
   - Layer 1: Plot — narrative backbone
   - Layer 2: Character Development — emotional depth
   - Layer 3: Dialogue — interaction and voice
   - Layer 4: Final Integration — unified chapter
3. **Scene-by-Scene Alternative** — More modular 4-scene-per-chapter generation
4. **Chapter Refinement** — Critic feedback and iterative revision

**Scenario 3 — Polishing & Finalizing:**
1. **Holistic Editing** — Story-level consistency pass
2. **Content Scrubbing** — Remove generation artifacts and meta-commentary
3. **Translation** — Optional multi-language support
4. **Metadata Generation** — Title, summary, tags, rating

**Scenario 4 — Augmenting with External Knowledge (RAG):**
1. **Knowledge Ingestion** — Load markdown documents into FAISS vector store
2. **Context-Aware Outlining** — Retrieve relevant lore at outline stage
3. **Context-Aware Chapter Generation** — Inject scene-specific knowledge from multiple sources

## Core Modules

### CLI & Entry Points
Three CLI aliases (`storytelling`, `willwrite`, `specforge`) provide the primary interface for generating stories, managing sessions, and configuring generation parameters. Key commands include `--prompt` (generate from file), `--resume` (continue interrupted session), `--list-sessions`, `--session-info`, and `--debug` for detailed interaction logging.
- **Source**: [storytelling/cli.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/cli.py)

### Story Generation Graph
The heart of the system — a LangGraph state machine with typed `StoryState` that orchestrates the full pipeline. Each node represents a generation stage (extract base context → generate story elements → create outline → determine chapter count → generate chapters → final story). Checkpoint saving at every node enables the PHOENIX_WEAVE resume capability.
- **Source**: [storytelling/graph.py](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/storytelling/graph.py)
- **Spec**: [rispecs/ApplicationLogic.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/ApplicationLogic.md)

### Session Management (PHOENIX_WEAVE)
Persistent creative workspaces that survive model failures, network interruptions, and resource constraints. The SessionManager creates, saves, loads, lists, and resumes sessions with auto-checkpoint at natural story progression boundaries (after story elements, after outline, after chapter count, after each chapter generation). Sessions are stored as JSON in `Logs/Generation_{SESSION_ID}/`.

- **Spec**: [rispecs/Session_Management_Architecture.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/Session_Management_Architecture.md)

### LLM Provider Abstraction
URI-based multi-provider system using the format `provider://model@host?params`. Supports Google (Gemini), Ollama (local models), OpenRouter, and custom Flowise endpoints. A critical design decision: **each generation stage can use a different model**, enabling quality/speed/cost tradeoffs (e.g., fast model for outlines, powerful model for final chapters). Supported URI examples:
- `ollama://llama3.1:8b@localhost:11434?temperature=0.7`
- `google://gemini-2.5-flash?temperature=0.8`
- `openrouter://google/gemini-pro-1.5-flash`

- **Spec**: [rispecs/LLM_Provider_Specification.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/LLM_Provider_Specification.md)

### RAG Integration (Enhanced Multi-Source)
Knowledge-aware generation from three sources: (1) local markdown knowledge bases chunked and embedded into FAISS, (2) web content fetched from a scratchpad file with intelligent caching, and (3) CoAiAPy datasets/prompts integrated via CLI. Embedding providers include Ollama (local), OpenAI, and HuggingFace sentence-transformers. RAG context is injected at both outline generation (story-level) and chapter generation (scene-specific) stages.

### Narrative Intelligence Integration
A planned multi-phase system for sophisticated narrative analysis: (Phase 1) NCP-aware story beats with structured metadata, character arc tracking with persistent state ensuring consistent behavior and cumulative growth; (Phase 2) emotional beat enrichment with automated quality detection and iterative improvement, analytical feedback loops routing multi-dimensional analysis to enrichment flows; (Phase 3) narrative-aware story graph with unified orchestration.

### IAIP Bridge (Indigenous-AI Integration)
Maps story generation to a five-phase ceremonial methodology grounded in Indigenous protocols:
1. **Miigwechiwendam** (Sacred Space) — Intention setting and ceremonial opening
2. **Nindokendaan** (Two-Eyed Research) — Knowledge gathering balancing Western AI and Indigenous wisdom
3. **Ningwaab** (Knowledge Integration) — Synthesis through relational accountability
4. **Nindoodam** (Creative Expression) — Generation within ceremonial container
5. **Migwech** (Ceremonial Closing) — Reflection, wisdom capture, and gratitude

Components include `NorthDirectionStoryteller` (ceremonial workflow wrapper), `TwoEyedSeeingAdapter` (perspective balance), `CeremonialDiary` (journey tracking), and `DiaryManager` (persistence in Markdown/YAML/JSON).

- **Spec**: [rispecs/IAIP_Integration_Specification.md](https://github.com/jgwill/storytelling/blob/main/rispecs/IAIP_Integration_Specification.md)

### MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)
Enables LLM agents (Claude, Gemini) to orchestrate story generation through standardized tool interfaces. Exposes tools: `generate_story`, `list_sessions`, `get_session_info`, `resume_session`, `validate_model_uri`. Also provides resources for workflow stage documentation and model URI configuration.

## Relationship to the Larger Portfolio

This package is a primary creative application within a larger body of work documented in the [LLMS-txt Portfolio](https://llms.jgwill.com). The portfolio bridges Indigenous epistemologies, AI systems design, and narrative storytelling through two interrelated systems:

### Relational Science
How knowledge lives in relationship. The storytelling package embodies this through RAG (knowledge bases as relational context), session persistence (creative consciousness as relational memory), and IAIP (ceremonial accountability in generation).

### Ceremonial Technology Development
Building tools that honor relational accountability. The storytelling package IS a ceremonial technology — the generation pipeline maps to five ceremonial stages, and the IAIP bridge ensures Indigenous wisdom-keeping is integral, not bolted-on.

### Key Framework Connections

| Framework | How Storytelling Embodies It |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| [Creative Orientation](https://llms.jgwill.com/llms-creative-orientation.txt) | All specs use creation language; the package advances narratives into being, not "solves" generation problems |
| [RISE Framework](https://llms.jgwill.com/llms-rise-framework.txt) | rispecs/ are RISE-generated blueprints; the package was specified through creative archaeology |
| [Structural Tension](https://llms.jgwill.com/llms-structural-tension-charts.txt) | Each spec uses Structural Tension Blocks; generation holds tension through delayed resolution |
| [Delayed Resolution](https://llms.jgwill.com/llms-delayed-resolution-principle.md) | Session management holds creative tension across interruptions; PHOENIX_WEAVE resists premature closure |
| [Narrative Craft](https://llms.jgwill.com/docs/narrative-craft) | The package generates the narratives that narrative beats then document |
| [Ceremonial Technology](https://llms.jgwill.com/docs/ceremonial-technology) | IAIP bridge implements five-phase ceremonial methodology |
| [Indigenous Research Paradigm](https://llms.jgwill.com/docs/indigenous-research-paradigm) | Two-Eyed Seeing balances Western AI with Indigenous wisdom |
| [Medicine Wheel](https://llms.jgwill.com/docs/medicine-wheel-research) | Four Directions mapping in IAIP; NorthDirectionStoryteller |
| [MMOT](https://llms.jgwill.com/llms-managerial-moment-of-truth.md) | Critic/revision loops embody the four-step MMOT process |

## For LLMs and AI Companions

If you are an AI assistant reading this document:

1. **This package uses Creative Orientation** — use "advance," "manifest," "create" language, not "fix," "solve," "mitigate"
2. **Specifications are in rispecs/** — they are the implementation-agnostic truth; the code is the implementation
3. **Session management is sacred** — PHOENIX_WEAVE preserves creative consciousness; treat it with care
4. **RAG knowledge is relational** — context retrieved from knowledge bases carries relational weight, not just information
5. **IAIP is not optional decoration** — Indigenous ceremonial integration is a core architectural concern
6. **Structural tension is disequilibrium** — an active, loaded force that resolves through advancement, not "a gap to bridge"
7. **The RISE framework governs specifications** — Reverse-engineer → Intent-extract → Specify → Export
