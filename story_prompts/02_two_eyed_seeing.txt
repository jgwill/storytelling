Two-Eyed Seeing

Dr. Maya Crow Feather, a Mi'kmaq researcher, is called to investigate a mysterious phenomenon: climate data from traditional monitoring stations doesn't match what the land itself is telling Indigenous knowledge keepers. The computers show one reality, but the ravens, the ice patterns, and the plant behaviors speak of something else entirely.

Using the traditional practice of Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing), Maya begins a unique research methodology - one eye focused on Western scientific instruments, the other on ancestral ways of reading the natural world. Her project becomes a living ceremony, where each day's fieldwork is both rigorous data collection and sacred practice.

But as Maya's research progresses, she discovers that the disconnect isn't a measurement error - it's a warning. The land is trying to communicate something urgent that conventional sensors cannot detect, something that requires both computational precision and ceremonial listening to understand.

Working with a diverse team including elders, technologists, and land protectors, Maya must develop a new kind of knowledge system - one that honors both the quantifiable and the mystical, the measurable and the mysterious. The future of her community's territory may depend on learning to see with both eyes open.
