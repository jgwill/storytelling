# Multiverse Convergence: Three Worlds United

## Story Concept
In a multi-universe system, three distinct worlds—Engineer's World, Ceremony World, and Story Engine World—are interconnected through a braided event-driven architecture. Each universe interprets shared events through its unique lens, transforming them into coherent story beats that reflect their respective worldviews.

## The Three Worlds

### Engineer's World
- Focuses on technical precision and system architecture
- Characters work with schemas, webhooks, and data flows
- Challenge: Technical schemas inadvertently create extraction patterns
- Growth: Learning to rebuild with ceremonial accountability

### Ceremony World
- Emphasizes Indigenous relational protocols and Four Directions
- Characters are protocol keepers and ceremony guides
- Challenge: Overwhelmed by webhook notifications
- Growth: Teaching AI systems about sacred event classification

### Story Engine World
- Centers on narrative structure and character development
- Characters are story weavers who process life into meaning
- Challenge: Parallel storylines converging unexpectedly
- Growth: Meta-awareness of interconnected narratives
