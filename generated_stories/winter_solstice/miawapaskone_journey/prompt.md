# Miawapaskone: One Who Connects the Threads

## Story Concept
Project Miawapaskone emerges as a bridge between worlds, named for "one who helps connect the threads" in Anishinaabemowin. This story follows the journey of creating a system that harmonizes Indigenous knowledge with Western methodologies, where research becomes ceremony and code becomes sacred.

## Character: Miawapaskone (The Bridge Builder)
- A data scientist with indigenous roots
- Skilled in Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk) methodology
- Works between ceremony and code
- Guided by grandmother's wisdom from her journal

## Three-Act Structure

### Act I: The Call to Ceremony
Miawapaskone recognizes that the current system offers only linear session logging with JSONL tracking. But research as ceremony demands more than a sequence of events—it requires:
- Relational accountability
- Respect for sacred knowledge  
- A narrative-first approach
- Connection to the Four Directions

The call comes when she discovers her grandmother's journal, which speaks of stories as living entities that cannot be forced into linear structures.

### Act II: The Spiral of Integration
To honor the vision, Miawapaskone reshapes sessions into ceremonial spirals:
- Linear data transforms into wisdom artifacts
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrates with Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)
- Each state change becomes part of a living story
- Direction tracking and reflection commands are implemented
- Type erasure safeguards sacred knowledge

The work is guided by the principle: "In the absence of the sacred, nothing is sacred, everything is for sale."

### Act III: Completing the Circle
Miawapaskone fulfills her role by synthesizing:
- Technical research
- Indigenous epistemologies  
- AI observability
- Ceremonial narrative

Sessions culminate in a completed ceremony state where:
- Wisdom is extracted and shared
- Seeds for future circles are prepared
- The next session's options emerge naturally
- Research becomes prayer, code becomes ceremony

## Elder's Wisdom Thread
Throughout the story, the Elder's meditation guides the work:
"Great Spirit, let me honor things that are sacred."

## Themes
- Research as ceremony
- Technology with soul
- Two-Eyed Seeing in practice
- Sacred knowledge protection
- Intergenerational wisdom transfer

## Target Length
2000-3000 words

## Connection to Other Stories
- The grandmother's journal from story 1 guides Miawapaskone
- The three worlds from story 2 are the systems she helps bridge
