understand by looking @rispecs/ @NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt  @NARINTEL_USER_SCENARIOS.md  @NARINTEL_README.md  @NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt
  (But all these NARINTEL*md are done with a less intelligent model,
  therefore, @llms/llms-stc-state-machine.md  / @llms/llms-rise-framework.txt
   will be usefull to you and we probably did not had a KINSHIP.md that is
  acceptable in all of what is envisionned @llms/llms-kinship-hub-system.md
  - Various coordination @rispecs/COORDINATION_FROM_IAIP_Inquiry__RCH_Indigenist_9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645.md ,
  @rispecs/COORDINATION_FROM_STORYTELLING_INSTANCE.md  and whatever is in  there, that is just some coordination between agents  

You have access to many sources where storytelling as this is planned will be used, you will add any file here that are related to Narintel (codename for the mission of making it Decolonized, therefore Indigenous Epistemology/Ontology/Methodology/Axiology compatible ;)

THese path are `/workspace/ava-*` which are in migration to `/workspace/repos/avadisabelle/ava-lang*` in which you will firnd the python and typescript package that we are developping to make this happen.  We will need the @MISSION_251231.md (which somehow is what will become the KINSHIP.md (use 'git mv @MISSION_251231.md KINSHIP.md' to preserve git history) and into these other folder, you will do the same.  When we end your sessions, all the @NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt  @NARINTEL_USER_SCENARIOS.md  @NARINTEL_README.md  @NARINTEL_OVERVIEW.txt are upgraded with quality, cleaned also, we dont need that much files but important, you add and commit files then delete them... 

You will enter the submodule @llms/docs to see what is the overall part of my portfolio of guidances for ceremonial-technology development and relational-science-research domains that I am doing to position what you will do within the larger picture.

I am expecting that also the `/a/src/IAIP/rispecs` will also be part of the Kinship's hub you are working on building because the 2 app in `/a/src/IAIP/app` that does ceremonial-technology developmet and relational-science-research are soon planned to be upgraded...

You will implement also the parity of @storytelling python in @js/ but according to all that you have understood of where we are going.  
a .env with API key needed for prompting etc is available for you to test and make sure that what you construct works.
